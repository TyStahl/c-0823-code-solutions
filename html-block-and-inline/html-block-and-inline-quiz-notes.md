## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- How do block-level elements affect the document flow?
  block elements always make new lines and take up the whole width of whatever parent element they exist in, so block elementes affect the document flow alot outside of styling
- How do inline elements affect the document flow?
  inline elements only take on the height and width of the element they are affecting, without styling, so they dont have a ton of affect on document affect alone. for instance if <em>emphasizing</em> a word will only emphasize the word because it only has the height and width of 'emphasizing'
