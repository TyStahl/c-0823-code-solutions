## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What is a **breakpoint** in responsive Web design?
a breakpoint is a maximum or minimum value that triggers some effect when reached
the points at which a media query is produced
- What is the advantage of using a percentage (_e.g._ `50%`) width instead of a fixed (_e.g._ `px`) width for a "column" class in a responsive layout?
it would be responsive on any size screen vs probably only responsive on screens with similar width
- If you introduce CSS rules for a smaller `min-width` _after_ the styles for a larger `min-width` in your style sheet, the CSS rules for the **smaller** `min-width` will "win". Why is that?
because both evaluate as true but the smaller one comes later in the css file
