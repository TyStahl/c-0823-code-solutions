## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What is a function in JavaScript?
  A function is a codeblock which allows the developer to perform operations repeatedly
- Describe the parts of a function **definition**.
  function keyword delcares a new function, function name, (parameters sperated by commas if multiple) go in parenthesis and curly braces to open the code block
- Describe the parts of a function **call**.
  to call a function:
  call the name of the function and pass arguments in place of its parameter or parameters

```function(parameter){

};

function(argument);
```

- When comparing them side-by-side, what are the differences between a function **call** and a function **definition**?
  the definition of a function is prescibing what actions to perform when called.
  calling a function is invoking those actions on whichever arguments are passed in.

- What is the difference between a **parameter** and an **argument**?
  a parameterr is a placeholder for a future argument and is used in the defining of a function
  a argument is any data that is substituted for the parameter and manipulated by the function when called.
- Why are function **parameters** useful?
  parameters are useful to help inform us what type of data our argument should be and to wait until a function is called to perform any calculations, expressions, or manipulations.
- What two effects does a `return` statement have on the behavior of a function?
  it ends the codeblock and produces a result or value
